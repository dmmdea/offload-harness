# GPU lease

## Purpose

The machine-wide, fenced, two-class lease that serializes GPU-heavy work across every
ingress — the harness CLI, the Node render runners, the fleet node, and anything else that
takes it. It exists so a text measurement and a media generation can no longer destroy each
other on a single shared card.

- **CLI:** `local-offload gpu status|reserve|release`
- **State:** `<state_dir>/gpu/{lease/meta.json, epoch}` — default `%ProgramData%\local-offload`
- **Decision record:** [ADR 0018](../architecture/decisions/0018-machine-wide-fenced-gpu-lease.md)

## Source map

| path | role |
|---|---|
| `internal/gpulease/gpulease.go` | **the only implementation**: `LeaseDir` (the one resolver), acquire/release, epoch fencing, the reclaim conjunction, `InspectDir` (the one read path) |
| `internal/gpulease/proc*.go` | per-platform liveness and process-start identity, exported so no consumer keeps a second copy |
| `internal/pipeline/pipeline.go` | takes the `media` lease around **every** generation call site (image ComfyUI + sdcpp, inpaint, image batch, run-graph, video, audio) and threads `GPU_LEASE_*` to the runner; inherits an ambient lease instead of re-acquiring; owns the in-process slot (`mediaSlot`) that arbitrates jobs sharing one inherited lease |
| `gpu_cmd.go` | the `gpu status\|reserve\|release\|hold` verbs, wrapper and `--detach` forms |
| `gpu_hide_windows.go`, `gpu_hide_other.go` | hidden spawn for the detached holder (a visible console gets closed, killing the hold) |
| `render/gpu-lock.mjs` | READ-ONLY participant: honours + fences an inherited lease, elects one unloader, drains, ComfyUI lifecycle. **Does not acquire.** |
| `internal/gpulock` | the read-only vision gate; delegates wholesale to `gpulease.InspectDir` |
| `internal/config` | `state_dir`, `gpu_lock_path` |

## Why it exists

One GPU, two very different consumers: llama-swap wants its tiers resident; ComfyUI wants the
whole card. Before this, only the Node render runners took a lock, so text work had no way to
say "I am using the GPU." A media job dispatched from elsewhere unloaded every GPU-resident
model mid-benchmark. The server log holds **3,356 unload calls, 330 of them the text
workhorse, and 0 for the CPU memory stack** — that last zero identifies `freeLlamaSwap` as the
caller, since excluding the memory stack is its own invariant.

## Using it

Prefer the **wrapper** form. The lease lives exactly as long as the command, so it cannot be
leaked by forgetting to release, and it composes like `timeout` or `nice`:

```
local-offload gpu reserve --class text --for 45m --reason "kv bench" -- <command...>
```

`--detach` holds the card in a hidden background process for an interactive session. It is the
weaker form by design — nothing ties the lease to a command's lifetime:

```
local-offload gpu reserve --class text --for 45m --reason "kv bench" --detach
local-offload gpu release --epoch <N>
```

`gpu status [--json]` reports the holder, its class, age, reason and declared expiry — and says
**"free (unreserved)"** explicitly, because an unreserved card is exactly when work is exposed;
that should be visible, not inferred from silence.

## What happens when the card is busy

A GPU job **queues behind the current holder for a bounded window, then defers** with the
holder's class, age and reason. Both halves are deliberate:

- **It queues** because the single slot exists to serialize GPU work, not to cancel it. A render
  arriving thirty seconds into someone else's render should run thirty seconds later. Dropping it
  would let a `gpu reserve --class text --for 45m` silently discard 45 minutes of media requests.
- **The queue is bounded** because the caller is usually one tool call, and blocking it for tens
  of minutes is indistinguishable from a hang. Past the window an honest ETA is more useful to a
  caller that can retry.

`gpu_wait_ms` (default **90 s**, matching `vision_gpu_wait_sec`) is the single ceiling for every
GPU task. `videogen_wait_ms` and `audiogen_wait_ms` are **retired and ignored** — they existed so
a cheap TTS was not starved behind a 20-minute video, which buys nothing at 90 s, and every
installed `config.json` still carries `videogen_wait_ms: 1200000`, so honouring them as overrides
would have quietly restored the old 20-minute wait on upgrade. A config carrying them loads
cleanly and prints a note naming the replacement.

Only **contention** is waited out — an unwritable or cloud-synced lease location comes back
immediately, because waiting cannot fix a configuration fault. A busy card is a **defer**, not a
failure: `generate-image --batch` exits 0 with `err_class: gpu_busy` rather than a non-zero error.

Two things keep the wait from becoming friction:

- **A `text` reservation that outlasts your window is answered immediately.**
  `gpu reserve --class text --for 45m` is an operator's *declared* duration, so there is nothing
  to wait for — you get the ETA now instead of 90 s later. A `media` holder is deliberately not
  treated this way: its expiry is a timeout *ceiling*, and a 25-minute video budget routinely
  finishes in three, so it is waited out.
- **Two jobs in the SAME process never poll each other.** They queue on an in-process slot and
  the waiter is handed the card the instant the holder releases — no timer, no file reads.

## What it costs when nothing is contending

**Nothing.** The lease adds no daemon, no scheduled task, no watchdog and no background thread.
Every timer below exists only while real work is in flight, and stops with it:

| when | what runs | cost |
|---|---|---|
| idle | nothing at all | zero |
| a render is running | one 15 s heartbeat per held lease, at most one per process | one small file write / 15 s |
| your job is queued behind another process | one probe per second, capped by `gpu_wait_ms` | two small file reads / s, ≤90 s |
| your job is queued behind one in the same process | blocks on a channel | zero — no polling |
| `gpu reserve -- <cmd>` | one 15 s heartbeat for the command's lifetime | one small file write / 15 s |
| `gpu reserve --detach` | a hidden holder polls once a second until released or expired | the only continuous poller; exits on its own |

`--detach` is the sole thing that keeps running after the command that started it, which is why
the wrapper form is preferred. It is an ordinary process, not a registered service: it exits by
itself when released, when fenced out, or at its declared deadline, and nothing respawns it.

Running the harness under a reservation **inherits** that lease:

```
local-offload gpu reserve --class media -- local-offload generate-video "…"
```

The child does not acquire a second lease — it would queue behind its own parent for the whole
window and then defer. If the inherited lease is no longer current (the parent was fenced out),
the job refuses instead of quietly taking a fresh one, so a lost reservation is visible.

## Classes

| class | who takes it | may unload models? |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | a benchmark, eval, or measured run | no |
| `media` | image / video / audio / run-graph | **yes**, once per lease |

Both are exclusive — one card, one holder. The label carries intent, not access control.

**Ordinary interactive text calls are deliberately NOT lease participants.** There are thousands
a day at ~46 ms and leasing them is untenable. This is a known limit, not an oversight: a short
interactive call can still land inside a media lease and pay a reload.

## How it stays correct

- **Machine-wide.** The previous lock defaulted under the OS temp dir, which is per-user on
  Windows — two security contexts held "the" lock simultaneously and nothing errored. An
  unwritable root now refuses to start rather than falling back per-user, and a root under a
  cloud-sync directory is refused outright (a replicated lock file would hand one GPU to two
  machines).
- **Fenced.** Each acquisition bumps a monotonic epoch kept outside the lease dir. Holders call
  `Check()` before anything irreversible. A laptop that slept through a takeover is fenced out
  instead of acting on the current holder's card.
- **Pid-recycle safe.** The holder's process start time is recorded beside its pid.
- **Reclaim needs both halves:** *(holder provably gone)* OR *(heartbeat stale AND declared window
  expired)*. A bare heartbeat timeout would expire a descheduled benchmark under exactly the load
  it exists to protect.
- **Release is epoch-guarded** — a fenced-out straggler cannot delete the current holder's lease.

## The drain

`POST /api/models/unload/<id>` **does not honour in-flight requests.** Measured on llama-swap
v242: an unload fired 3 s into a generation returned in 1,265 ms without draining, and the
generation died at 4,107 ms with `502 Bad Gateway`.

So `freeLlamaSwap` drains before it unloads. `quiesceLlamaSwap` polls each tier's
`/upstream/<id>/slots`, where `is_processing` is true exactly while a slot is generating
(verified across a 23 s / 1500-token run). It is **fail-safe, not fail-open-silent**: if `/slots`
cannot be read (older llama-server, `--no-slots`), it reports `drained:false` and names the
unobservable tiers, and the caller logs that it proceeded without a verified drain instead of
pretending. A stuck tier times out rather than deadlocking the render queue.

## Windows file semantics the lease depends on

Two behaviours that do not exist on POSIX shape the implementation, and both were found by a
concurrency test rather than by reading:

- **Delete is pending, not instant.** Removing a file whose handle is still open marks it
  delete-pending; an `O_EXCL` create in that window fails with `ACCESS_DENIED`, not
  `EEXIST`. That window is precisely the moment a holder releases — exactly when every waiter is
  polling — so the acquirer most likely to hit it is the one that should have won. Both the claim
  and the epoch lock retry it instead of treating it as a fault.
- **A reader blocks a delete.** `os.ReadFile` opens without `FILE_SHARE_DELETE`, so `os.Remove`
  on the claim fails while anyone is inspecting it. A failed release *leaks* the lease until both
  halves of the reclaim rule fire, so removal retries.

Neither is defensive padding: with waiters polling once a second, both races are ordinary
traffic. Measured under six concurrent acquire/release workers, 1 in 48 cycles failed before the
retries were added.

## Node interop

**Node does not acquire.** `internal/gpulease` is the only implementation of acquisition,
staleness, fencing and the epoch counter. The Go caller takes the lease and threads
`GPU_LEASE_DIR`, `GPU_LEASE_EPOCH` and `GPU_LEASE_CLASS` down; `withGpuSlot` honours what it is
given.

A GPU job with **no** lease REFUSES, naming the fix, rather than grabbing the card:

```
local-offload gpu reserve --class media -- node render/comfy-generate.mjs ...
```

`--no-lock` remains the deliberate escape hatch for "nothing else can touch this GPU".

### Why the Node implementation was deleted rather than repaired

Two languages independently implementing one concurrency rule produced a **new** divergence in
every review round, and each was individually fixed before the next was found:

| round | divergence | symptom |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | different atomic tokens (dir vs `meta.json`) | both sides held the lease |
| 1 | `os.FindProcess` vs `process.kill(pid,0)` | ACCESS_DENIED read as dead here, alive there |
| 2 | non-atomic epoch write | **24.5%** of concurrent reads saw a torn counter and restarted the fence at 1 |
| 2 | no claim-freshness grace on one side | Node deleted Go's in-progress claim |
| 3 | a third staleness rule in `gpulock` | a live 3-hour holder read as free |

The defect was never any single bug — it was the duplication. What Node keeps is what is
genuinely its job: honour and **fence** against an inherited lease, elect **one** unloader per
lease, **drain** before unloading, and run the ComfyUI lifecycle.

The heartbeat lives in a per-epoch `hb.<epoch>` file rather than in the record, so a stale holder
renewing after a takeover updates something nothing reads. Read-only consumers call
`gpulease.InspectDir` rather than re-deriving the judgement — a second reader is how this
diverges, and it did: when the heartbeat moved, a record-only view briefly called a live,
renewing holder stale the moment its declared window lapsed.

## Known gaps

- **The reservation is a convention.** A raw `curl :11436` loop, a graph posted straight to
  ComfyUI, or a forgotten `gpu reserve` gets no protection.
- **The lease reduces the number of teardowns; the drain is what makes one safe.** Both needed.
- **Head-of-line blocking is structural** — a 45-minute video blocks everything behind it.
- `internal/pipeline` does not yet take a `media` lease around its own generation calls; the Node
  runner does, on the same path, so arbitration holds today.
