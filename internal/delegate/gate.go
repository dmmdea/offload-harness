// gate.go is the placement decision (§S3 as reshaped by roast deltas 3+5):

// context ceiling with room to run.

// (~700) + per-step transcript growth (tool call + result + plan text,
// ~150 tok/step) × core.AgentMaxStepsCap (12) ≈ 1800 — totalling ≈ 3100,
// held at a round 3072. At an 8k seat this leaves the documented ~2–4k-token
// effective doc budget; a bigger reserve would mostly refuse work a 12-step
// run can actually finish.

// (name AND text: both are materialized for the sub-agent to read), the raw
// output schema bytes (echoed into the constrained final step), and each
// acceptance string (echoed to the sub-agent).
//
// WHY chars/3, stated honestly (roast delta 5 requires the label): this is a
// DELIBERATE conservative bound, not a tokenizer. The house lesson is
// "tokenize, don't estimate" — chars/4 was measured 2x off on Gemma — but at
// placement time v1 has no remote tokenizer to ask, so the estimate leans the
// safe direction instead: /3 overshoots typical English prose (~4 chars/token
// ⇒ ~33% inflation), and the cases where even /3 undershoots (tokenizer-dense
// content) are backstopped by specReserve's padding and the 12-step remote
// cap. It is used ONLY as an upper-bound GATE — never to claim a fit — and a
// real-tokenizer count replacing it is the recorded v2 upgrade.

// Place decides which node runs st. The rule, exactly as reshaped:

//     wins — delegation exists to keep work flowing while the local GPU is
//     occupied, never to chase throughput on a weaker seat (quality-first,
//     operator verbatim: "not a race about speed").
//   - localBusy true ⇒ the lowest-QueueDepth remote that passes the hard
//     gate (ties: first listed, so the caller's roster order is the stable
//     preference order). No remote passes ⇒ LOCAL regardless — queued-local
//     beats ineligible-remote every time.
//
// Place is pure: it never probes anything. Callers build the inputs from
// FetchNodeView + LocalBusy.

// remoteEligible is the §S3 HARD gate — every condition must hold, and each
// one fails toward local:
//
//   - AgentEnabled: the node's operator opted it into the agent lane.
//   - AgentResident: the seat is roster-VERIFIED on the node (advertised from
//     its cached probe), not merely configured.
//   - adequate: EstTokens+specReserve <= AgentCtxTokens — the contract provably
//     fits the advertised ceiling with room for the loop itself. An
//     unadvertised ceiling (0) can never fit — "unknown" is not a capacity.
//     The arithmetic lives in fit.go's adequate() so the gate and the
//     smallest-ADEQUATE-seat fit score can never drift apart on what "fits"
//     means.
//   - OutputSchema present (len>0 — bytes, not merely non-nil): the reshaped
//     verifiability requirement (roast delta 3). Remote output merges only
//     after mechanical verification, and the schema is what makes the result
//     mechanically checkable; free-prose acceptance no longer counts.
//   - Depth == 0: only an ORIGIN contract may travel (hop limit 1). The

//     additionally derives effectiveDepth ≥ 1 for whatever arrives.

// the lease dir through gpulease.LeaseDir — THE one resolver; a second
// resolution order is how the lease silently splits, per
// docs/systems/gpu-lease.md — then read it with gpulease.InspectDir, the
// read-only inspection path built for consumers that do not own a Manager
// (the vision gate uses the same one). No Manager is opened (Open probes
// writability and mkdirs), nothing is acquired, no epoch is bumped: a
// placement probe must never CONTEND for the card it is asking about.
// InspectDir already applies the full reclaim rule, so a crashed holder's
// stale lease reads as not held.
//
// gpuLockPath/stateDir are the config's gpu_lock_path/state_dir, threaded by
// the caller (the plan sketched a zero-arg LocalBusy, but resolving the lease
// dir WITHOUT the config's overrides would re-create the split-lease defect
// on any box that sets them). Any resolution failure reads as NOT busy:
// Place then keeps the work local, which is always the safe placement.
